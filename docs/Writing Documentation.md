# Writing Documentation

## Top-level module documentation

The first "standalone" comment in a module is treated as the main documentation block for that module.

```re
/**
 * This is a standalone block
 *
 * Note the trailing semicolon, and the two asterisks at the start (must be exactly two).
 */;
```
